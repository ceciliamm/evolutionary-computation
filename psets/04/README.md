## Files structure

* **`pset/`** is a Python module that contains
    * **`algorithms.py`** which have the SGA implementation
    * **`individuals.py`** contain the individuals abstraction
    * **`utils.py`** utilities used for encoding
    * **`visualizador.py`** file provided by course instructor to draw individuals
    structured as JSON.
* **`PSet Description.pdf`** is the original Problem Set definition.
* **`P02.pdf`/`P02.tex`** problem set solved, start here. The latter is the LaTeX source code.
* **`Jupyter Notebooks`**:
    * **`PSet.ipynb`** contains some implementations of the problem
    like the cost function, candidate generation function and the multiple annealing schedule strategies. Also plot results.
